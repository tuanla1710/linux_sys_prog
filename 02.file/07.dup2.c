/*
* It is good to check the order of output written to a file
*/

/*
* printf doesn't necessarily call write every time. 
* Rather, printf buffers its output. 
* That is, it often stores its result in a memory buffer, 
* only calling write when the buffer is full, or on some other conditions.

* write is a fairly expensive call, 
* much more expensive than copying data into printf's buffer, 
* so reducing the number of write calls provides a net performance win.

* If your stdout is directed to a terminal device, 
* then printf calls write every time it sees a \n. 
* If your stdout is directed to a file (or to /dev/null), 
* then printf calls write only when its internal buffer is full.
